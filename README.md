Experiment: In this experiment, three algorithms (Hungarian, Nearest Neighbor, and Brute
Force) were implemented to find solutions to the notorious Traveling Salesperson Problem.
Since TSP is NP Hard, we wanted to compare these three different algorithmsâ€™ runtimes. The
Hungarian algorithm was coded, but unable to be fully implemented with solving TSP. However,
the runtime of Brute Force and Nearest Neighbor were fully implemented in relation to TSP and
compared through plots. <br>

The tsp_node class creates nodes with data which acts as a label for the TSP problem.
dsa_final.ipynb: This file contains the methods that generate and test the graphs for the Brute
Force algorithm, Nearest Neighbor algorithm, and Hungarian algorithm. The tsp_node class
creates nodes with data which acts as a label for the TSP problem. <br>

More specifically, the node_generator function is given a graph and adds n nodes to it and the
edge_generator function, given the same graph with n nodes, generates edges of random
length between 10-50 between each node and every other node in the graph. Additionally, it
returns a matrix representing the grab and edge lengths for the Hungarian algorithm. The node
labeler makes a dictionary with labels for each node, which makes the networkx graph look
cleaner and makes it more clear which node is which. The brute_force_solver is given a graph
with nodes and edges, and generates every possibility for the TSP on that graph, returning the
route with the lowest combined edge weights.<br>

nearest_neighbor_finished.ipynb: This file contains the implementation of Nearest Neighbor
algorithm before it is run with the edge and node generators. It takes in two values: the starting
city coordinate, and a list of all cities that need to be visited. Further explanations of methods
are documented within the file.
